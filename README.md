# CodeAlpha Internship Tasks

This repository contains the projects I completed as part of my internship at **CodeAlpha**.

## Projects

### 1. Credit Scoring Model
**File:** `credit-score.ipynb`

A machine learning project to predict the probability of a client defaulting on their credit card payment.
- **Dataset:** UCI Credit Card Dataset (included as `UCI_Credit_Card.csv`).
- **Key Techniques:** Data preprocessing, EDA, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SHAP analysis.
- **Goal:** Classify customers as potential defaulters or non-defaulters.

### 2. Handwritten Character Recognition
**File:** `handwritten-character-recognition.ipynb`

A deep learning project to recognize handwritten digits.
- **Dataset:** MNIST (loaded directly via Keras).
- **Key Techniques:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Image Preprocessing, Model Evaluation.
- **Goal:** Accurately classify images of handwritten digits (0-9).

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebooks using Jupyter Lab or VS Code.
